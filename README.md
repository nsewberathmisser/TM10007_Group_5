This repository contains the code files for our Machine Learning group assignment: distinguishing lipoma from well-differentiated liposarcoma.
Two code files can be found in this repository:
The first file uses PCA for feature selection. 
The second file uses L1 Regularization for feature selection. 
Both files test the following classifiers: SVC Linear, KNN, SVC RBF, RF, MLP, and Ensemble. 
The dataset used for these files can be found at https://github.com/jveenland/tm10007_ml.git .
